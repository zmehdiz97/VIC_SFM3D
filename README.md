# VIC PROJECT: 3D Reconstruction Using Structure-from-Motion
![Report] (https://github.com/zmehdiz97/VIC_SFM3D/blob/main/VIC_report.pdf)


### Abstract
motion is a technique of estimating the
motion of the camera and recovering three-dimensional
(3D) scenes from 2-dimensional (2D) image sequences
taken from two or multiple different views of one camera.
The objective of this project is to identify the various ap-
proaches to generating sparse 3D reconstructions using the
Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms. First, we will de-
scribe the classical pipeline and steps of SfM. Then we will
implement this algorithm step by step.
